#Distributed Graph Renderer

This distributed graph visualisation app is integrated with Gephi and supports visualisation of any graph built using Gephi. It automatically transforms graph based on GDO configuration, and it supports various interactive features such as panning, zooming and searching. Before we visualise it, we need to prepare the graphs in Gephi and transform the data using Node.js into suitable formats.

1. Start the .NET app, input the path to "yourGraph.graphml" and click ‘Render Graph’.
2. Your beautiful graph will now be shown on the GDO.
