# GDO SDK 

GDO SDK is App Development Framework and Management software for Large High Resolution Display Environments.

This framework was developed at and for the Data Observatory at Imperial Collegeâ€™s Data Science Institute

The purpose of the software is to:

* Allow deployment of applications on the cave cluster
* Abstract app developers from underlying layers
* Allow division of cave into multiple sections
* Allow on-demand deployment of app instances on those sections

## Effective Immediately: Master will only contain stable and tested merges, all branches and commits will converge on Dev branch, get tested on Preprod and pushed to master to be deployed on Prod.

## Contributors are responsible to make sure there are no copyright infringements in their branches or apps. Owner of the repo will not take responsibility for this. Please contact us for removal of material you think infringes other copyrights.
