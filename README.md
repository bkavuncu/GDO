# GDO SDK 

GDO SDK is App Development Framework and Management software for Global Data Observatory.

The purpose of the software is to:

* Allow deployment of applications on the cave cluster
* Abstract app developers from underlying layers
* Allow division of cave into multiple sections
* Allow on-demand deployment of app instances on those sections

## Effective Immediately: Master will only contain stable and tested merges, all branches and commits will converge on Dev branch, get tested on Preprod and pushed to master to be deployed on Prod.
